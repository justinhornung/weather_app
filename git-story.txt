  Green Bean is a one year old 45lb pitbull mix. Her hobbies include toy destruction, eating, and running for long intervals. She's a crazy dog to her owner, Justin. She freaks out in the car ride to the park, but she loves the dragging her owner around the walking path part of the trip.

  Grean Bean is a prancy little thing who absolutely annoys her four year old big brother.
